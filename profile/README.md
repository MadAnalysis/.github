# MadAnalysis 5 - for Collider Phenomenology & LHC Recasting

MadAnalysis 5 is a framework for phenomenological investigations at particle colliders. 
Based on a C++ kernel, this program allows to efficiently perform, in a straightforward 
and user-friendly fashion, sophisticated physics analyses of event files such as those 
generated by a large class of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators. MadAnalysis 5 comes with 
two modes of running. The first one, easier to handle, uses the strengths of a powerful 
Python interface to implement the analysis utilising a set of intuitive commands. The 
second one requires implementing the analysis in the C++ programming language directly 
within the core of the analysis framework. This opens unlimited possibilities concerning 
the level of complexity that can be reached by the analysis, which is only limited by the 
programming skills and the originality of the user.

## Repository Outline

* [madanalysis5](https://github.com/MadAnalysis/madanalysis5) : This is the main 
  MadAnalysis 5 - software repository. You can find all the [release versions here](https://github.com/MadAnalysis/madanalysis5/releases).
* [ma5-expert](https://github.com/MadAnalysis/ma5_expert) : This is a plugin for 
  expert mode users. It's a tool to read native MadAnalysis 5 cutflows and historgrams
  which converts them into python data classes.
